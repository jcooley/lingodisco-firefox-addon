I developed this addon using the Python-basd [Jetpack add-on creator for Firefox](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/labs/jetpack/jetpack-sdk-latest.zip). It is a simple add-on but may be a useful reference for anyone thinking of using Jetpack.

The addon scrapes a translation page loaded in a hidden panel to get a translation instead of using an API (something that's easy to do with Jetpack) so it may contribute something new. This add-on is configured for Google Translate and Bing but it could work with any service that takes a form input and supports instant translation.

Contributions are welcome. It's MPL 2.0 to begin with if you need another license let me know.
